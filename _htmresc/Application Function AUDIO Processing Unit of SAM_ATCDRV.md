## 1 Introduction to Audio API Interface
The VMCU framework provides a set of Audio interfaces for processing Audio related services, and recording and playback functions can be achieved through calling the relevant interfaces.

The Audio interface is defined in the header file SamAudio.h and must be included when used.

### 1.1 Audio function initialization sam_audio_init
|Interface|int sam_audio_init(uint8 atcIndex,sam_audio_callback audioCallback,sam_audio_urc_callback urcCallback)|
|---|---|
|Function|The Audio module initialization function, when calling any of the following functions, first needs to register the Audio module in the system. This function only needs to be called once. However, if the Audio module is still needed after calling the void sam_audio_deinit (void) function, this function needs to be called again for initialization.|
|Parameters|atcIndex:Which serial port channel should be selected? Generally, this parameter is passed as 0.<br/>audioCallback:This parameter is passed as a callback function pointer, which returns the execution result of any function from 1.3 to 1.7 when executed.<br/>urcCallback:This parameter passes a pointer to a callback function, which means that when executing any function in 1.3 to 1.7, if the function in 1.3 to 1.7 has a URC report, it will be output through this callback function.|
|Return|0:indicates successful execution.<br/>-1:indicates execution failure. Please check if the correct parameters are passed in.|
|Notes|None|

### 1.2 Cancel Audio sam_audio_deinit
|Interface|int sam_audio_deinit(void);|
|---|---|
|Function|This function is used to log out the Audio module.|
|Parameters|None|
|Return|0:indicates successful execution<br/>-1:indicates that there are other Audio tasks in progress|
|Notes|None|

### 1.3 Play an audio file sam_audio_play
|Interface|int sam_audio_play(char *fileName,uint8 playPath,uint8 repeat);|
|---|---|
|Function|This function is used to play an audio file, which can be in AMR, WAV, MP3, or PCM format. The PCM file must have a header, otherwise it can`t be played.|
|Parameters|fileName:The file name of the audio file that needs to be played, which can include the file path. If there is no file path, it is specified on the C: drive of the module. The maximum length of the file name is 60 bytes.<br/>playPath:0:local path;1:remote path (just support voice call);2:local path and remote path<br/>repeat:0: Don`t play repeatedly, only play once; 1.. 255: The number of times it is played repeatedly.|
|Return|0:indicates successful execution<br/>-1:Please check if the passed parameters are correct.|
|Notes|None|

### 1.4 Stop playing Audio sam_audio_stop_playing
|Interface|int sam_audio_stop_playing(void);|
|---|---|
|Function|Stop audio playback.|
|Parameters|None|
|Return|0:indicates successful execution<br/>-1:indicates that there are other Audio tasks in progress|
|Notes|None|

### 1.5 Obtain the current recording status sam_audio_get_record_status
|Interface|int sam_audio_get_record_status(void)|
|---|---|
|Function|Obtain the current recording status.|
|Parameters|None|
|Return|0:indicates successful execution<br/>-1:indicates that there are other Audio tasks in progress.|
|Notes|None|

### 1.6 Used for recording audio files sam_audio_record_start
|Interface|int sam_audio_record_start(const char *fileName,uint8 recordPath)|
|---|---|
|Function|Used for recording audio files, the file format is WAV or AMR, and the recording will be saved in the C:/directory of the system. The SD card only supports Non ASCII string paths.|
|Parameters|fileName:Save the audio file name of the recording, with a maximum length of 60 bytes. If no file path is entered, the default is C:/directory.<br/>recordPath锛171:local path;2:remote path (get voice from cs call);3:mixd (local and remote).|
|Return|0:indicates successful execution<br/>-1:Please check if the passed parameters are correct.|
|Notes|None|

### 1.7 Stop recording sam_audio_record_stop
|Interface|int sam_audio_record_stop(void)|
|---|---|
|Function|Stop recording.|
|Parameters|None|
|Return|0:indicates successful execution<br/>-1:indicates that there are other Audio tasks in progress|
|Notes|None|

## 2 Introduction to Audio interface usage examples
This chapter mainly introduces how the application calls the Audio interface to achieve Audio playback.

### 2.1 Main function entrance
The initialization of Audio, like the initialization of other modules, calls the sam_audio_init() function in TesterInit() before the while loop.

After initialization, if the application wants to perform Audio related services, such as playing Audio file, it can be executed inside the While loop. Developers can design according to their own logic, and further introduction will be provided in subsequent chapters.

### 2.2 Record and save to the c:/recording. amr file

```c
    sam_audio_record_start("c:/recording.amr",1);
    sam_audio_record_stop();
```

### 2.3 Play the recording file

```c
    sam_audio_play("c:/recording.amr",0,0);
    sam_audio_stop_playing();
```
